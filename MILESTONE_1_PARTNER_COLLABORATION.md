# Milestone 1: Partner Collaboration Workflows
## Implementation Plan - Tier 1.1

**Project**: MCP Server for Habu  
**Milestone**: Partner Collaboration Workflows  
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 days  
**Priority**: Immediate Value (Tier 1)

## üéØ Milestone Overview

**Jobs to be Done**: "I need to invite partners, manage their access, and coordinate collaboration in clean rooms"

This milestone builds upon our successful clean room creation wizard by adding comprehensive partner management capabilities. Partners are essential for clean room collaboration, and this workflow addresses the critical gap between creating clean rooms and enabling productive collaboration.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### **TypeScript Interface Design**

```typescript
interface PartnerInvitation {
  id: string;
  cleanroomId: string;
  partnerEmail: string;
  invitationMessage?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'sent' | 'accepted' | 'expired' | 'cancelled';
  createdAt: string;
  expiresAt: string;
  acceptedAt?: string;
  inviterName: string;
  inviterEmail: string;
}

interface PartnerPermissions {
  partnerId: string;
  cleanroomId: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'analyst' | 'viewer' | 'custom';
  questionPermissions: {
    canView: boolean;
    canEdit: boolean;
    canClone: boolean;
    canRun: boolean;
    canViewResults: boolean;
    canViewCode: boolean;
  };
  datasetPermissions: {
    canViewSchema: boolean;
    canViewSample: boolean;
    canConfigureMapping: boolean;
  };
}

interface OnboardingStep {
  step: string;
  title: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  instructions: string;
  nextSteps: string[];
  requiredActions: string[];
}
```

### **Error Handling Strategy**

1. **Invitation Errors**:
   - Invalid email addresses with format validation
   - Duplicate invitations with merge/update options
   - Clean room access permissions with clear messaging
   - Network/API failures with retry mechanisms

2. **Permission Errors**:
   - Insufficient privileges with escalation guidance
   - Conflicting permissions with resolution suggestions
   - Invalid partner IDs with search/verification tools
   - Bulk operation failures with partial success handling

3. **Onboarding Errors**:
   - Partner setup delays with automated reminders
   - Configuration mismatches with validation guidance
   - Communication failures with alternative contact methods
   - Progress tracking issues with manual override options

### **Integration Points**

1. **Clean Room Creation Wizard**: Seamless transition from creation to partner invitation
2. **Question Management**: Automatic permission setup for new questions
3. **Dataset Management**: Partner access coordination for shared datasets
4. **Analytics Tools**: Partner access to results and insights
