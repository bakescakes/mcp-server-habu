## üß† BREAKTHROUGH: Smart Detection for Question Execution ‚ú® **NEW**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Intelligent partition parameter detection  
- **Achievement**: Eliminates 0-result question runs caused by missing date range parameters
- **Technology**: Real-time SQL analysis of question templates to detect required partition parameters
- **Impact**: Enhanced user experience with intelligent guidance and educational explanations
- **Coverage**: Works across all question types (Attribution, Reach, CRM segmentation)

### How Smart Detection Works:
1. **SQL Analysis**: Analyzes `customerQueryTemplate` to detect @exposures, @conversions, @partner_crm tables
2. **Parameter Detection**: Intelligently determines required date range parameters for each table type
3. **User Guidance**: Provides clear examples and complete usage patterns when parameters are missing
4. **Educational**: Explains WHY partition parameters matter for efficient data processing
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work without changes

### Business Impact:
- ‚úÖ **Eliminates Confusion**: No more zero-result questions due to missing parameters
- ‚úÖ **Accelerates Learning**: Educational explanations help users understand clean room data concepts
- ‚úÖ **Improves Efficiency**: Prevents processing of excessive data without proper filtering
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise UX**: Intelligent assistance that scales with user sophistication

## üéâ PROJECT COMPLETE: New Connection Wizards ‚úÖ

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** - All 6 high-value connection wizards implemented
- **Achievement**: 50% data source coverage target ACHIEVED  
- **New Tools**: Google Ads Data Hub, Amazon Marketing Cloud, Snowflake Enhanced, HubSpot, Salesforce
- **Summary**: [NEW_WIZARDS_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md](./NEW_WIZARDS_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md)
- **Business Impact**: Major marketing and CRM platforms now fully supported

## OAuth2 Authentication Breakthrough

**Problem Solved**: After extensive testing, we discovered the correct OAuth2 implementation:

**Working Configuration:**
- **Token Endpoint**: `https://api.habu.com/v1/oauth/token`
- **Grant Type**: `client_credentials` 
- **Authentication**: Basic Auth with client credentials in header
- **Key Assignment**: Secondary API key = CLIENT_ID, Primary API key = CLIENT_SECRET
- **Response Format**: Uses `accessToken` (not `access_token`)

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
const response = await axios.post('https://api.habu.com/v1/oauth/token', 
  { grant_type: 'client_credentials' },
  {
    auth: {
      username: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
      password: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET
    },
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  }
);
```

**Key Discovery**: The Habu API returns `accessToken` (not the standard `access_token`), requiring custom token extraction logic.
