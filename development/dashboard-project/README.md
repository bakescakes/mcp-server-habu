# 🖥️ MCP Server Dashboard Project

**React dashboard for monitoring MCP Server for Habu tool status and testing progress**

---

## 📋 **Project Summary**

This directory contains a separate React dashboard project that was developed alongside the MCP Server for Habu to provide visual monitoring and status reporting. The dashboard consumes STATUS.json data from the GitHub repository and displays it through a professional web interface.

### 🏗️ **Architecture**
```
GitHub STATUS.json → Railway API Backend → Vercel React Frontend
```

### ✨ **Features**
- **📊 Project Overview**: Metrics cards showing tool counts and testing progress
- **⚙️ Tools Explorer**: Category-based navigation with search and filtering
- **📈 Analytics**: Charts and visualizations of completion rates
- **📅 Recent Activity**: Timeline of development activities
- **🔧 System Status**: Health monitoring and performance indicators

## 🎯 **Purpose & Context**

### **Original Goal**
Create a professional stakeholder-ready dashboard for monitoring the MCP Server development progress, tool testing status, and project metrics.

### **Current Status**
The dashboard project achieved its core objectives:
- ✅ Professional React UI with dark theme and modern styling
- ✅ Real-time data consumption from STATUS.json
- ✅ Comprehensive data visualization with charts and metrics
- ✅ Production deployment on Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)

### **Relationship to Main Project**
This dashboard is a **supplementary project** that provides visual monitoring for the main MCP Server. The core value and functionality remains in the MCP Server itself (`mcp-habu-server-bundle/`).

## 🔄 **Development Timeline**

1. **Initial Development**: Created comprehensive React dashboard
2. **Production Deployment**: Deployed to Railway + Vercel
3. **Debugging Phase**: Extensive troubleshooting of deployment issues
4. **Repository Cleanup**: Moved dashboard files to separate directory
5. **Documentation**: Consolidated dashboard documentation

## 🚀 **Quick Start** (If Needed)

If you want to run or modify the dashboard:

```bash
# Navigate to dashboard frontend
cd dashboard/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

**Backend**: Already deployed on Railway at `https://mcp-server-habu-production.up.railway.app`  
**Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel (check vercel.json for configuration)

## 📝 **Notes**

- This dashboard project generated significant documentation during development and debugging
- All dashboard-related files have been moved here to keep the main repository focused on the MCP Server
- The dashboard remains fully functional and can be maintained separately if needed
- For MCP Server development, focus on the files in the repository root and `mcp-habu-server-bundle/`
