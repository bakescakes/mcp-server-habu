# Manual Railway Configuration Required

## Current Status âœ…
- Backend updated to fetch from GitHub API
- Code deployed successfully to Railway
- Backend correctly attempting GitHub fetch (getting 404 as expected for private repo)
- Falling back to local STATUS.json file

## Next Steps ðŸ”§

**You need to manually add the GITHUB_TOKEN to Railway:**

### Option 1: Railway Web Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select project: "empowering-eagerness"
3. Select service: "mcp-server-habu" 
4. Go to "Variables" tab
5. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: `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`
6. Service will auto-redeploy with the new variable

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
railway login
railway environment --name production
railway variables set GITHUB_TOKEN=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
```

## Testing After Configuration

Once the GITHUB_TOKEN is added, test with:

```bash
curl -s "https://mcp-server-habu-production.up.railway.app/api/status" | jq -r '._api'
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "source": "GitHub API",
  "fetchedAt": "2025-08-10T00:xx:xx.xxxZ",
  "repository": "bakescakes/mcp-server-habu",
  "filePath": "STATUS.json", 
  "githubSha": "abc123...",
  "authenticated": true
}
```

## Vercel Dashboard Test

After Railway is configured, the Vercel dashboard should automatically start receiving live STATUS.json data from the private GitHub repo.

**Dashboard URL**: https://mcp-server-habu-hd1x.vercel.app/

**Ready for your action**: Please configure the GITHUB_TOKEN in Railway using either method above, then let me know and I'll test the end-to-end flow.
