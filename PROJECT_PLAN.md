# Habu MCP Server - Detailed Project Plan

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for the Habu MCP Server, organized by development phases with specific milestones and technical requirements.

## API Analysis Summary

Based on the comprehensive review of the Habu Clean Room API, the following key domains were identified:

### Core API Domains
1. **Clean Rooms** (`/cleanrooms`) - 15 endpoints
2. **Data Connections** (`/data-connections`) - 8 endpoints  
3. **Questions** (`/question`) - 4 endpoints
4. **Clean Room Questions** (`/cleanroom-questions`) - 12 endpoints
5. **Question Runs** (`/cleanroom-question-runs`) - 8 endpoints
6. **Partners & Users** (`/cleanrooms/{id}/partners`, `/cleanrooms/{id}/users`) - 12 endpoints
7. **Datasets** (`/cleanrooms/{id}/datasets`) - 6 endpoints
8. **Flows** (`/cleanrooms/{id}/cleanroom-flows`) - 8 endpoints
9. **Credentials & Sources** (`/organization-credentials`, `/data-sources`) - 8 endpoints

### Key Insights for MCP Design
- **Complex Relationships**: Clean rooms, questions, datasets, and partners have intricate dependencies
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Most business operations require multiple API calls in sequence
- **State Management**: Operations often require polling for completion status
- **Permission Model**: Granular permissions across organizations, partners, and questions
- **Data Validation**: Extensive field configurations and mappings required
