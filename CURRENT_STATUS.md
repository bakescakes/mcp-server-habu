## 🔧 Recent Debug Victory: Question Run Status Tool ✨ **FIXED & RENAMED**

**Issue Discovered**: `question_run_monitoring_dashboard` tool incorrectly reporting successful runs as failed  
**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- ✅ **API Investigation**: Found that CRQ-138029 actually completed successfully
- ✅ **Error Handling Bug**: Tool reported "ERROR (404)" for runs that completed and may be archived
- ✅ **Run Name Logic**: Clarified that "MCP_Run_1753844461752" uses JavaScript timestamps

**Solution Implemented**: 
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with contextual messages for 404/403/401 responses
- ✅ Changed confusing "ERROR" status to "API_ERROR" with explanatory context
- ✅ Added notes explaining that 404 may indicate completed-but-archived runs
- ✅ **RENAMED TOOL**: `question_run_monitoring_dashboard` → `check_question_run_status`
- ✅ Updated description to clarify it provides point-in-time status checks (not continuous monitoring)

**Result**: Tool now provides accurate status reporting with a name that matches its actual functionality.
