# üîç Partner Invitation Debug Analysis

## **Key Finding: Invitation "Success" vs Reality**

### **API Response Analysis:**
‚úÖ **API Returned**: Success with invitation ID `b53ced78-9a16-4475-8e56-181fd2c6f629`  
‚ùå **Reality Check**: Cleanroom still shows **0 partners** and **None** partner organizations  
‚ùå **Email Status**: No email received at scott.benjamin.baker@gmail.com  

### **Evidence:**
**From list_cleanrooms() for CR-045487:**
```
- **Partners**: 0
- **Partner Organizations**: None
```

**This suggests:**
1. **Mock/Test Mode**: API might be in test mode that creates records but doesn't send emails
2. **Invitation Pending**: Invitation created but doesn't count until accepted
3. **API Inconsistency**: Success response doesn't guarantee actual invitation creation
4. **Email System Issue**: Invitation created but email delivery failed

### **Next Steps to Verify:**
1. **Fix manage_partner_invitations tool** - Currently broken with `toUpperCase()` error
2. **Direct API Testing** - Test the actual invitation endpoints directly
3. **Email Verification** - Check spam/promotions folders
4. **API Mode Verification** - Confirm if we're in production vs test mode

### **Critical Question:**
**Is the Habu MCP Server actually sending real invitations, or are we in a test/mock mode that simulates success without real email delivery?**

This is essential to verify before marking the invitation tool as "working" in production.
