# 🔧 Critical Bug Fix Complete: MCP Tools Explorer

## 🚨 **Issue Identified & Resolved**

### **Problem**
The user reported critical Python runtime errors appearing on the MCP Tools Explorer page:
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'filtered_categories' where it is not associated with a value
```

### **Root Cause**
Variable scoping issue where `filtered_categories` was being referenced in the filter summary calculation before it was defined in the code flow.

### **Solution Applied**
1. **Moved filter application logic** before the filter summary section
2. **Consolidated duplicate filter helper functions** 
3. **Fixed variable scoping** by ensuring `filtered_categories` is defined before use
4. **Removed debug sections** that were causing confusion

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Code Changes Applied**
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
# Filter summary calculated before filtered_categories was defined
for category, tools in filtered_categories.items():  # ❌ UnboundLocalError

# AFTER (fixed):
# Filter application moved before summary calculation
filtered_categories = categories.copy()
if category_filter != "All":
    filtered_categories = {category_filter: categories[category_filter]}

# Then calculate summary
for category, tools in filtered_categories.items():  # ✅ Works perfectly
```
